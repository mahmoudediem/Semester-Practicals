Method C – Archive Compression + Cloud/Remote Storage :

Below are the documented steps for performing a backup using archive compression and optionally uploading to
cloud or remote storage. These steps describe the required procedure but do not require executing them.

1. Generate a Timestamp:
Create a timestamp that will be used in the archive file name:
cmd command :
set TS=%DATE:~10,4%-%DATE:~4,2%-%DATE:~7,2%_%TIME:~0,2%-%TIME:~3,2%-%TIME:~6,2%

2. Create a Compressed Archive (.tar.gz) of the Repository
Use the tar utility to compress the entire repository folder:
cmd command:
tar -czf Practical-12-%TS%.tar.gz Practical-12

This command produces a compressed backup file named with the current timestamp.

3. Verify the Archive Contents
Check the contents of the generated .tar.gz file:
cmd command
tar -tzf Practical-12-%TS%.tar.gz

This ensures the archive includes all expected files and folders.

4. Upload to Cloud Storage
If cloud storage is available (AWS S3, MinIO, or similar), the archive can be uploaded using the appropriate CLI.
Example (AWS S3):
aws s3 cp Practical-12-%TS%.tar.gz s3://your-bucket/backups/Practical-12-%TS%.tar.gz

5. Upload to Remote Backup Server
The archive can also be uploaded to a remote server via SCP or SFTP:
scp Practical-12-%TS%.tar.gz user@backupserver:/path/to/backup/

6. Restore from Archive
To restore the repository from the backup:
cmd command:
tar -xzf Practical-12-%TS%.tar.gz -C restore-folder

This extracts the contents back into a working directory.
