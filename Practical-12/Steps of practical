Git Repository Backup Methods : General explanation of how each method works

1) Backup Using Git Bundle
A Git bundle is a complete snapshot file that contains the entire repository in one portable package. The backup process involves generating this bundle 
so it captures all commits, branches, and repository history as a single file. It is usually named with a timestamp so the backup can be easily identified later.
After the bundle is created, it can be checked or verified by listing its contents or attempting to clone from it, ensuring that the snapshot is valid and complete.

2) Backup Using Mirror Clone
A mirror clone creates an exact copy of the central repository, including every branch, tag, reference, hook, and piece of metadata stored inside the .git directory.
Unlike a normal clone, a mirror clone is designed to be a perfect replica of the original repository’s internal structure. This makes it suitable for backup purposes
because it preserves the entire state of the repository exactly as it exists on the server. Whenever the mirror clone is refreshed, it pulls all new updates and keeps 
the backup fully synchronized with the source repository.

3) Backup Using Archive Compression or Remote Storage
Another method of backing up a repository is to compress it into an archive and store it either locally or remotely. The repository folder can be turned into a .tar.gz file,
which reduces its size and makes it easy to store or move. Instead of keeping the archive locally, the backup can also be uploaded to cloud storage services such as S3 or MinIO,
or sent to a remote backup server over SSH. For setups that need frequent updates, tools like rsync can be used to maintain incremental backups, which only copy the changes 
instead of re-copying the entire repository each time. This approach is flexible, works with different storage systems, and can be automated easily.
